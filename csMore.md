### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI components).

### Astro

Astro is a new JavaScript-based static site builder.
Astro is a framework for generating web applications on top of popular UI frameworks like React, Preact, Vue, or Svelte.
Your content-rich static sites will be significantly faster using Astro since less JavaScript is served. For example, Astro sites can load 40% faster with 90% less JavaScript compared to Next.js.

If your project demands dynamic data handling, server-side rendering, and a well-established ecosystem, Next.js is the better choice.
However, if you prioritise performance and want to leverage multiple web frameworks for your static or mostly static sites, Astro is an excellent option.
