Everything is a widget
Material / Cupertino design
Scaffold appbar container image icon
Stateless Stateful
Build method
Architecture:
widget tree (ui as code)
embrace: platform differences
one codebase (ui + logics)

Rdmp:
Dart: variables strings conditions loops functions lists map OOPs async-await file-handling
Flutter: widgets - stateful/stateless singleChild/multiChild
Firebase: auth storage realtime
Api: post get REST
State management: bloc provider getx
Architecture: mvc mvvc
Errors: RedScreen(Gray for the same in release/build mode) WhiteScreen YellowBlack

## Start

> flutter create app_name
<!--  -->
> flutter run

Flutter run key commands:

- r Hot reload.
- R Hot restart.
- h List all available interactive commands.
- d Detach (terminate "flutter run" but leave application running).
- c Clear the screen
- q Quit (terminate the application on the device).

or

> VScode -> ctrl shift P -> Flutter:new app -> app_name (-> choose folder if not):

## File structure

Various components of the structure of the application are explained here:

- android − Auto generated source code to create android application
- ios − Auto generated source code to create ios application
- lib − Main folder containing Dart code written using flutter framework
  - lib/main.dart − Entry point of the Flutter application
- test − Folder containing Dart code to test the flutter application
  - test/widget_test.dart − Sample code
- .gitignore − Git version control file
- .metadata − auto generated by the flutter tools
- .packages − auto generated to track the flutter packages
- .iml − project file used by Android studio
- pubspec.yaml − Used by Pub, Flutter package manager
- pubspec.lock − Auto generated by the Flutter package manager, Pub
- README.md − Project description file written in Markdown format

## Note

### Widget

The core concept of the Flutter framework is In Flutter, Everything is a widget.
Widgets are basically user interface components used to create the user interface of the application.
In Flutter, the application is itself a widget. The application is the top- level widget and its UI is build using one or more children (widgets), which again build using its children widgets.
This composability feature helps us to create a user interface of any complexity.

If a widget can 'change' when a user interacts with, it's stateful.
A stateless widget never changes. ex: Icon, IconButton and Text.

#### Widget hierarchy

MyApp(root/top-lvl) -> MaterialApp -> MyHomePage(property:home) -> Scaffold -> {AppBar, Center->Text}

- MyApp is the user created widget and it is build using the Flutter native widget, MaterialApp.
MaterialApp has a home property to specify the user interface of the home page, which is again a user created widget, - MyHomePage.
- MyHomePage is build using another flutter native widget, Scaffold
- Scaffold has two properties – body and appBar
- body is used to specify its main user interface and appBar is used to specify its header user interface
- Header UI is build using flutter native widget, AppBar and Body UI is build using Center widget.
- The Center widget has a property, Child, which refers the actual content and it is build using Text widget

## Code

```dart
// Imports the flutter package, material.
// The material is a flutter package to create UI according to the Material design guidelines specified by Android:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// This is the entry point of the Flutter application. 
// Calls runApp function and pass it an object of MyApp class. The purpose of the runApp function is to attach the given widget to the screen.

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

// Widget is used to create UI in flutter framework.
// StatelessWidget is a widget, which does not maintain any state of the widget.
// MyApp extends StatelessWidget and overrides its build method.
// The purpose of the build method is to create a part of the UI of the application.
// Here, build method uses MaterialApp, a widget to create the root level UI of the application.
// It has three properties - title, theme and home.


class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
   // This widget is the root of your application.
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Hello World Demo Application',
         theme: ThemeData(
            primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
         ),
         home: MyHomePage(title: 'Home page'),
      );
   }
}

// MyHomePage is same as MyApp except it returns Scaffold Widget.
// Scaffold is a top level widget next to MaterialApp widget used to create UI conforming material design.
// It has two important properties, appBar to show the header of the application and body to show the actual content of the application.
// AppBar is another widget to render the header of the application and we have used it in appBar property.
// In body property, we have used Center widget, which centers it child widget.
// Text is the final and inner most widget to show the text and it is displayed in the center of the screen.

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
   MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
   final String title;

   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text(this.title),
         ),
         body: Center(
            child:
            Text(
               'Hello World',
            )
         ),
      );
   }
}

// Run the app
```
